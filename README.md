# Facade Probability Risk Map

This map displays a risk probability rating for all NYC buildings in the Façade Inspection Safety Program (FISP) Local Law 11 universe.
Buildings with a higher prediction probability value are more likely to exhibit high-risk outcomes such as specific façade-related violations,
unsafe conditions, or façade-related accidents. Risk scores may be used to better inform proactive enforcement actions.
